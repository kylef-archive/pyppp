### Using PyPPP with a Django Project

Once you've installed PyPPP and want to use it in your Django applications, do the following:

1. Add ``pyppp.django`` to the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting of your Django project.
2. Add ``'pyppp.django.backends.PPPBackend'`` to ``AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS`` in the settings.py file for your Django project. You're settings.py should look something like:
    ```AUTHENTICATION_BACKENDS = (
        'django.contrib.auth.backends.ModelBackend',
        'pyppp.django.backends.PPPBackend',
    )```
3. Change ``LOGIN_URL`` to ``/ppp/login/`` to your settings.py.
4. Change ``LOGOUT_URL`` to ``/ppp/logout/`` to your settings.py.
5. Create the necessary templates (there are examples included).
6. Add this line to your site's root URLConf: ``(r'^ppp/', include('pyppp.django.urls')),``
7. Now all that is left to do, is run ``python manage.py syncdb`` on your project so that the PPP Users table is added to the database.

Once you have installed and added PyPPP to your Django project, you can use the url ``/ppp/card/`` to grab the current card. Login using PPP at: ``/ppp/login/``, and logout at ``/ppp/logout/``.
